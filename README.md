# Enigma
--------------
## Functionality
- [x] Enigma Class with encrypt and decrypt methods successfully implemented. 
  - In this project I have been able to ceate encrypt and decrypt methods that have been successfully implemented other than one. I could not seem to navigate the last decrypt method that is as follows:
  ```
  it 'can decrypt based on encryption key' do
      expected = {
          decryption: "hello world",
          key: "02715",
          date: "040895"
        }

    expect(@enigma.decrypt(encrypted[:encryption], "02715")).to eq(expected)
  end
  ```

- [x] Encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces successfully implemented
  - For the command line interfaces, they have been successfully implemeted so that I get a specific output message when running: `ruby ./lib/encrypt.rb message.txt encrypted.txt` and `ruby ./lib/decrypt.rb encrypted.txt decrypted.txt 82648 240818`.

## Object Oriented Programming
- [x] Project is broken into logical components that are appropriately encapsulated. 
  - My project has been split into a few components. I have one `spec` file for testing. There is an `enigma class` file containing all the methods necessary for the tests to pass. Also, there is a `calculable` module for all the calculations to execute the correct returns on the `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods. 

- [x] No classes are unreasonably small or large, or contain knowledge/information/behavior that they shouldnâ€™t know about. 
  - Both the class and module are no longer than 60 lines. I compacted them by removing certain methods and tacking on different researched enumerables in order to clean up the `module`.

- [x] Student can articulate the single responsibilities of the various components.
  - Each and every single one of my methods in the `class` and `module` has a written explanation for its purpose(why it is there, what it is doing, and why it was implemented to reach a certain return value).


## Ruby Conventions and Mechanics
- [x] Code is mostly properly indented, spaced, and lines are not excessively long. 
 
- [x] Class, method, variable, and file names follow convention. 

- [x] Some enumerables/data structures chosen are the most efficient tool for a given job, and students can speak as to why those enumerables/data structures were chosen. 

- [x] At least one hash is implemented in a way that makes logical sense.
