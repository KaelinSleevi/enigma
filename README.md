# Enigma
--------------
## Functionality
- [x] Enigma Class with encrypt and decrypt methods successfully implemented. 
  - In this project I have been able to ceate encrypt and decrypt methods that have been successfully implemented.
  
- [x] Encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces successfully implemented.
  TBD

## Object Oriented Programming
- [x] Project is broken into logical components that are appropriately encapsulated. 
  - My project has been split into a few components. I have one `spec` file for testing. There is an `enigma class` file containing all the methods necessary for the tests to pass. Also, there is a `calculable` module for all the calculations to execute the correct returns on the `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods. 

- [x] No classes are unreasonably small or large, or contain knowledge/information/behavior that they shouldnâ€™t know about. 
  - Both the class and module are no longer than 60 lines. I compacted them by removing certain methods and tacking on different researched enumerables in order to clean up the `module`.

- [x] Student can articulate the single responsibilities of the various components.
  - Each and every single one of my methods in the `class` and `module` has a written explanation for its purpose(why it is there, what it is doing, and why it was implemented to reach a certain return value).


## Ruby Conventions and Mechanics
- [x] Code is mostly properly indented, spaced, and lines are not excessively long. 
  - All code is properly indented, spaced, and no lines are excessively long. My `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods are about 20 lines long including the `end`.
 
- [x] Class, method, variable, and file names follow convention. 
  - All the class, method, and variable names in this project follow convention.
    
  
- [x] Some enumerables/data structures chosen are the most efficient tool for a given job, and students can speak as to why those enumerables/data structures were chosen. 
  - The enumerables/data structures were all chosen to function within the project for a specific reason. The main new enumerables I have not used in the past and had to research are as follows:
  ```
    .zip
    .rotate
    .merge!
    .chars
    .each_with_index
    ```
  - Each of the enumerables used had a reason for being used and were the most effecient possible for the result of each individual methods used. In order to get the desirable outcome in this project, using these enumerables was not crucial, but was the most effecient outcome.

- [x] At least one hash is implemented in a way that makes logical sense.
  - I have implemented three hashes in their own methods `keys`, `offset`, `key_shifts`. Each are their own individual methods and a hash that has the exact defined result that I desired.


## Test Driven Development

- [x] Every method is tested at both the unit and integration level, and completely verify expected behavior (i.e., if a single method does 3 things, all 3 things are explicitly tested). 
  - Each method is tested. I have helper methods that are being tested through the larger methods. For the individual methods such as `alphabet_set`, `date_generator`, and `key_generator`.

- [x] Obvious edge cases are addressed. git history demonstrates students are writing tests before implementation code.
  - Edge cases have been addressed by implementing stubs in all the necessary tests.

- [x] Test coverage metrics show coverage at 99% or greater.
  - Test coverage is at 100%



## Version Control

- [x] Minimum 30 commits and 3 pull requests. 
  - In this project I have used 78 commits and 18 branches in total with 21 pull requests.
 
- [x] More than half of your pull requests include related and logical chunks of functionality, and are named and documented to clearly communicate the purpose of the pull request. 
  - All my pull requests included logical chunks and were named clearly. There are a few pull requests that included components that were not fully described by the branch name. I got caught up in the work I was doing and forgot to switch branches before moving on.

- [] No more than 3 commits include multiple pieces of functionality.
  - Many of my commits include multiple pieces of functionality.
